<h1>Chickem</h1>
<p>Our authentic version of this classic Chinese dish, with natural sweetness and a warm chilli flavour to spice things up.For the sauce, put the red pepper, chunks of chilli and pineapple juice in a pan and bring to the boil. Cover and cook for 10 mins, then pur√©e in a food processor. Return to the pan with the pineapple chunks, chilli halves, star anise, tamarind, sugar and vinegar. Gently simmer for 20-30 mins until reduced and sticky. Keep warm, or reheat to serve.</p>
