<h1>Chicke</h1>
<p>Our authentic version of this classic Chinese dish, with natural sweetness and a warm chilli flavour to spice things up.For the sauce, put the red pepper, chunks of chilli and pineapple juice in a pan and bring to the boil. Cover and cook for 10 mins, then purée in a food processor. Return to the pan with the pineapple chunks, chilli halves, star anise, tamarind, sugar and vinegar. Gently simmer for 20-30 mins until reduced and sticky. Keep warm, or reheat to serve.</p>
<h1>Beef</h1>
<p>Whip up this Chinese flash-fried steak with a sweet gingery sauce and red peppersPut the beef in a bowl and toss in the cornflour and five-spice. Heat the oil in a wok or large frying pan until hot, then add the beef and fry until golden and crisp. Scoop out the beef and drain on kitchen paper. Pour away all but 1 tbsp oil. Add the pepper, half the chilli, the white ends of the spring onions, garlic and ginger to the pan. Stir-fry for 3 mins to soften, but don’t let the garlic and ginger burn. Mix the vinegar, soy, chilli sauce and ketchup in a jug with 2 tbsp water, then pour over the veg. Bubble for 2 mins, then add the beef back to the pan and toss well to coat. Serve the beef on noodles with prawn crackers, if you like, scattered with the remaining chilli and the green parts of the spring onions.</p>
<h1>Sushi</h1>
<p>Points to remember: Rinse the sushi rice in cold water until the water runs clear, then soak roughly two parts rice to three parts cold water in a saucepan for 30 minutes. Next, bring the rice to the boil, cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the rice has absorbed all the water and is tender. Check the packet instructions for exact timings.
Stir through the rice vinegar and sugar. Cool the rice down as quickly as you can by spreading it onto a baking tray and covering with a slightly damp tea towel. Place a nori sheet on top of your sushi rolling mat. Dampen your hands to prevent sticking, then pick up a handful of rice and spread evenly on your nori sheet, leaving the top third uncovered. Place a thin row of filling ingredients across the middle of the rice. Hold the near edge of the mat, lift and roll away from you, encasing the filling. Ensure the ingredients stay in place and the rice sticks. Dampen the top boarder with a little water to seal. Wrap tightly in cling film and chill until firm. Brush your knife with rice vinegar to prevent sticking and cut the roll into neat rounds. Serve with pickled ginger and a dollop of wasabi.</p>
